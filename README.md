## What is Swish? 

Swish is an BasketBall fan-made app, that shows realtime  scoreboard with realtime player stats. It also includes a selectable date calendar to show all  games, a page to visualize east and west conferences standings and a player searcher screen (that can be filtered by teams and/or value) where we can check all the player stats along its career.
